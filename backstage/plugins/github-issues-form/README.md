# github-issues-form

Welcome to the github-issues-form plugin!

_This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI_

This is a form that takes Title and Body text inputs from the user to copy to an opened GitHub issue to submit to the team managing the internal instance of backstage, a bug fix or feature request, which will be posted to the project backlog.

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn dev` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/github-issues-form](http://localhost:3000/github-issues-form).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
